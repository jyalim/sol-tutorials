Tutorials for CUDA Quantum Version 0.4.1
========================================

Forked from [Nvidia's Github Repo][nvidia].

The tutorial on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (`vqe.ipynb`) was
"benched" due to permission issues with `openfermion`'s testing data. As
of this version of CUDA-Quantum, the testing data and directory have to
be World-writable, which is an issue for a University maintained
distribution of CUDA-Quantum.
